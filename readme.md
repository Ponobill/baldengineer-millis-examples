These examples are the Bald Engineer's millis() Cookbook.

Each example comes from a user request. Most have detailed explanations of how they work at on my blog, baldengineer.com.

You can send me ideas and questions for more examples.

However, no. I will not do your traffic light homework problem. ;)
